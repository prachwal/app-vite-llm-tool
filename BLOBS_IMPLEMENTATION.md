## 🏗️ Technical Implementation

### State Management
- Using Preact signals for reactive state
- Global signals for file list, container list, loading states
- Local state for UI interactions and error messages

### Material-UI Integration
- Consistent with existing theme system
- Responsive design with breakpoints
- Error handling with Alert components
- Loading states with CircularProgress

### Error Handling
- Network error catching
- API error responses with structured messages
- User-friendly error alerts with dismiss functionality
- Loading states during async operations

### File Operations
- Upload: Multi-file support via file input
- Download: Blob creation with proper MIME types
- Delete: Confirmation dialog before deletion
- Preview: Type-specific rendering with fallbacks

## 🧪 Testing Status

### Manual Testing ✅
- Application runs without TypeScript errors
- Netlify Dev server operational on port 8000
- Main application server running on port 5175
- API endpoints respond correctly:
  - `GET_STORES` returns available containers
  - All blob operations functional

### Remaining Testing Tasks
- [ ] Unit tests for components
- [ ] Integration tests for API
- [ ] E2E tests for complete workflows

## 📝 Usage

1. **Navigate to Blobs page**: Click "Blobs" in navigation
2. **Select container**: Use dropdown to choose container
3. **Upload files**: Click "Upload" button or drag & drop
4. **Browse files**: Click files in left panel to preview
5. **File operations**: Right-click for context menu
6. **Container management**: Use +/- buttons to add/delete containers

## 🔧 Architecture Benefits
